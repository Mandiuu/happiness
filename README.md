# Shinny happy people

In this project, I decided to look beyond the figures of the World Happiness Report 2024: I looked for what makes a country happier, talked to experts, and was delighted to create this site using HTML, CSS, R, and JavaScript. I also used Illustrator, Canva, and ai2html. 
I enjoyed using Emoji Kitchen the most, so please enjoy it too. https://emojikitchen.dev/
